The Odin Project Assignment using JavaScript


# Description
Remember playing Rock, Paper, Scissors in your child hood and you had to use only your hands to play the game? Well get ready to play it in digital form. The rules of the game are simple:
- Rock > Scissors
- Scissors > Paper
- Paper > Rock
You will be playing against a "Computer" and whomever is the first to get 5 points win the game. To play another round, a popup will appear and you can click the "Play Again?" button and the page will refresh to a new game. Enjoy!

# What I Learned
A LOT! Working on this project has really pushed me out of my comfort zone by getting more hands on with JavaScript. So far, I've learned:
- How to create a pop up window
- I learned how to use window.location.reload() to refresh the page 
- I learned that you can not use the "break" condition in an if/else statement inside a for loop that is inside a function
- Most importantly, problem solving. There was a lot of issues I dealt with when working with this project. But thanks to strategic planning and  completing the project one small task at a time, I was able to finally complete this project.
